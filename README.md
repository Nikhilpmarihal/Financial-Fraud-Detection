Introduction

Financial Fraud Detection involves monitoring transactions and customer behavior to identify and prevent fraudulent activity. Juniper Research (2022) estimates that global online payment fraud will exceed $343 billion between 2023 and 2027. Organizations rely on fraud detection to minimize financial losses, protect customers, and maintain trust.

Common Types of Fraud

Payment Fraud – Unauthorized transactions using stolen payment information.

Return Fraud – Exploiting return policies with stolen, counterfeit, or illegitimate products.

ACH Fraud – Illicit transfers via bank account and routing numbers.

Chargeback Fraud – Illegitimate refund claims after fulfilled purchases.

Account Takeover (ATO) – Criminal access to accounts like banking, e-commerce, or mobile services.

Fraud Detection Methods

Machine Learning & AI – Identifies patterns and anomalies in real-time.

Behavioral Analytics – Detects deviations in user behavior.

Anomaly Detection – Flags unusual activities against normal baselines.

Identity Clustering – Groups user identities to reveal fraud patterns.

Data Analytics – Extracts insights from large datasets to spot risks.

Key Challenges

Evolving fraud techniques limit rule-based systems.

Remote and fast transactions increase vulnerabilities.

False positives can harm customer trust.

Multiple transaction types (apps, crypto, loans, cards) add complexity.

Dataset

The dataset is a synthetic mobile money transactions dataset, simulating real-world activities and fraudulent behaviors over 30 days. It includes transaction types such as CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT, and TRANSFER.
